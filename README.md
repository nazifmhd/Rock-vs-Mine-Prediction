# **Rock vs. Mine Prediction using Logistic Regression**

This project demonstrates how to classify objects as either **Rock** or **Mine** using **Sonar Data** and the **Logistic Regression** machine learning algorithm. The implementation is done in Python using **Google Colaboratory**.

---

## **Project Overview**
- **Objective:** Build a machine learning model to classify sonar data objects as Rock or Mine.
- **Algorithm Used:** Logistic Regression.
- **Tools:** Python, Google Colaboratory.
- **Dataset:** The Sonar dataset (available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks))).

---

## **Project Structure**
- **`Rock_vs_Mine.ipynb`:** Python notebook containing the implementation.
- **`README.md`:** Project documentation.
- **`requirements.txt`:** Python libraries required for the project (optional).

---

## **Dataset Description**
The Sonar dataset contains 60 attributes representing the strength of sonar signals at different frequencies, followed by a label:
- **R:** Represents Rock.
- **M:** Represents Mine.

This dataset is ideal for binary classification problems.

## **Steps to Run the Project**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Clone the repository to your local system:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction.git
cd Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
````
### **2. Install Dependencies**
Clone the repository to your local system:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### **3. Open and Run the Notebook**
- Open the `Rock_vs_Mine.ipynb` file in Google Colaboratory or Jupyter Notebook.
- Upload the dataset if required.
- Execute the notebook cells step-by-step to train and test the model.

---  

## **Workflow**
- Load and explore the Sonar dataset.
- Preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, encoding).
- Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
- Build a Logistic Regression model for binary classification.
- Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy.
## **Technologies Used**
- Python: Programming language.
- Google Colaboratory: For running Python code in the cloud.
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib/seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning model building and evaluation.
## **Output**
The Logistic Regression model is used to classify whether the input sonar signal corresponds to a Rock or a Mine. The model's performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
## **Results**
- The model successfully classifies objects with significant accuracy.
- Model accuracy may vary depending on the dataset split and preprocessing techniques.
